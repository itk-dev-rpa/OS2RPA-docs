# Orchestrator

The Orchestrator is used by admins to control process schedules,
read logs and edit constants/credentials used by automation processes.

To run Orchestrator make sure OpenOrchestrator is installed and run the following command
in the command line:

```
python -m OpenOrchestrator -o
```

If you want to create a shortcut instead of typing into the command line, you can simply create a .bat
file containing the command above. Then you just have to double-click the .bat file to launch Orchestrator.
