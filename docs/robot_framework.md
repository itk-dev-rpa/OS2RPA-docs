# Robot Framework

The git repository [Robot Framework](https://github.com/itk-dev-rpa/Robot-Framework)
can be used as a template for any automation processes to be used with OpenOrchestrator.

It handles most boilerplate code needed for creating new automation processes such as:

- Project setup for installation as a module.
- Creating a virtual environment for the process to run in.
- Connection to Orchestrator.
- Retry loops.
- Error notification by email using SMTP.
- And other useful things.

Read the readme on the projects Github page for more info.
